# Doodle Identifier

## Description
The Doodle Identifier was designed by me and some others members of my Data Science course at Le Wagon, with the purpose of putting our knowledge into practice. This is a site app, where we have a Canva for the user to draw, with the user drawing we have a model that can identifies what the draw is and give the user an output of what was draw. In this project, we used Python, Keras TensorFlow, Docker image and learned how to put live a functional site that uses an API with a model that we created to predict something. It was magnifying to see everything working together and getting an amazing result. This project was developed in just two weeks, so we couldn't tune our model to the best possible outcome, but for the time we had, it was a very promising work.
